<b>Q)</b> What is this project for?
</div>
<div>
<b>A)</b> This project is meant to perform basic browser operations for developers who wish to either design with or develop the engine further for their own purposes.
    The engine is designed with modability in mind. If there is a base engine functionality that a developer would like to change, they can override virtually any part of the engine to fit their needs.
